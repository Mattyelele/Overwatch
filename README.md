## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Overwatch was created because I wanted to make a bot for a friends server to handle reaction roles and other things. This is my first bot I am releasing, I've tried creating bots before but I've gave up when I started running into problems.


## Notes <a name = "Notes"></a>

Overwatch is a discord bot that is designed to watch over your discord server. This is still a work in progress and isn't for multiple discord use on one bot token, I do plan on making a bot that is able to be used in a multiple discord servers and with a web panel.
